#Plant Leaf Disease Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on developing an automated system to detect diseases in plant leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By analyzing leaf images, the system identifies visual patterns like spots, discoloration, and texture changes, classifying them into healthy or diseased categories. The model preprocesses images through resizing, normalizing, and data augmentation to enhance accuracy and robustness.

Trained on a labeled dataset of plant images, the model achieved up to 95% training accuracy and provides a scalable solution for real-time disease detection via mobile or drone-based platforms. This project offers a significant advancement for agricultural productivity, helping to reduce crop losses and improve food security.
